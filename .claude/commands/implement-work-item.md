# Implement Work Item

Execute the plan already captured in the `<!-- IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE -->` comment on a GitHub
issue, then post a QA report. You are not designing here — the design exists.

**Issue to implement:** `$ARGUMENTS`

---

## Phase 0 — Load the guide

Resolve `ISSUE_NUMBER` and `REPO_SLUG` from `$ARGUMENTS` (bare number or URL; slug from
`git remote get-url origin`). Then:

```bash
gh issue view ISSUE_NUMBER --repo REPO_SLUG --json number,title,body,labels,comments
```

Find the comment starting with `<!-- IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE -->`. If there is none, stop and
say to run `/refine-work-item ISSUE_NUMBER` first.

Parse its sections: Refined Scope, Assumptions, Affected Layers, Files to Create / Modify,
Data Contracts, Validation Rules, Business Rules, Implementation Order, Test Cases,
AC → Task Mapping, Prerequisites, Open Questions.

If Prerequisites names an open issue with no `<!-- QA-REPORT -->` comment, warn and wait for
confirmation before continuing.

---

## Phase 0.5 — Branch

Derive `feature/ISSUE_NUMBER-<first four words of the title, lowercased and hyphenated>`.

Create it, or switch to it if it already exists. Never implement on `master`. Confirm with
`git branch --show-current` and tell the user which branch you are on.

---

## Phase 1 — Prepare

Create a task list, one task per step in Implementation Order, and keep it current.

Read `CLAUDE.md` and follow it.

Verify a clean baseline before writing anything:

```bash
dotnet build MtgaCollectionAdvisor.slnx --no-incremental -v minimal
dotnet test src/MtgaCollectionAdvisor.Core.Tests/MtgaCollectionAdvisor.Core.Tests.csproj
```

If the build fails because a running instance locks a DLL, stop the app
(`taskkill //IM "MtgaCollectionAdvisor.Web.exe" //F`) and retry — that is not a real break.
If the baseline is genuinely broken, stop and report it.

---

## Phase 2 — Implement

Follow Implementation Order exactly, one step at a time.

- Use the exact paths from Files to Create / Modify.
- Read a file before modifying it; change the minimum necessary.
- Implement fully. No `// TODO` stubs.
- Follow the Data Contracts as written. If one is ambiguous, resolve it via `CLAUDE.md` and
  record the decision for the QA report.

Do **not** add packages the guide did not ask for. This repository deliberately has a small
dependency set: `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` in `Core`, xUnit in the test project. There is no
mocking library and no assertion library — tests use plain `Assert`, matching the existing
test files.

Build after each layer:

```bash
dotnet build MtgaCollectionAdvisor.slnx -v minimal
```

Three failed fix attempts on the same error → stop and ask.

---

## Phase 3 — Tests

Write every test in the guide's Test Cases table into the file(s) listed.

- xUnit, plain `Assert`, no mocking library.
- Prefer pure tests over tests that touch storage. If storage is unavoidable, create a
  throwaway SQLite file and delete it in teardown — call
  `SqliteConnection.ClearAllPools()` first or Windows keeps the file locked.
- No test may depend on MTG Arena running, on the network, or on the user's real database.

```bash
dotnet test src/MtgaCollectionAdvisor.Core.Tests/MtgaCollectionAdvisor.Core.Tests.csproj
```

Three failed attempts on one test → leave it failing, mark it `❌ COULD NOT AUTO-FIX` in the
QA report, and say what you tried. Never delete or skip a failing test.

---

## Phase 4 — Verify the real app

```bash
dotnet build MtgaCollectionAdvisor.slnx -c Release -v minimal
```

Then run it and check what actually reaches the browser:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/MtgaCollectionAdvisor.Web/MtgaCollectionAdvisor.Web.csproj --no-build -- --no-browser &
# wait ~15s, then:
curl -s http://localhost:5199/ -o page.html -w "%{http_code}"
```

Assert, at minimum:

- HTTP 200.
- The markup this issue adds is present.
- `<!--Blazor:` markers appear — without them the page is static and **nothing is
  clickable, with no error anywhere**. Their absence is a real bug, not a test artifact.
- Features that already worked still render.

Stop the app afterwards (`taskkill //IM "MtgaCollectionAdvisor.Web.exe" //F`).

Browser automation is usually unavailable, so click-through paths (typing, clicking,
drag) generally **cannot** be verified here. Do not claim otherwise — write them up under
Manual Testing Required with concrete steps and expected results.

Anything touching the memory scanner also needs MTG Arena running; if it is closed, say so
rather than reporting the scan as verified.

---

## Phase 5 — Commit and report

Commit the work with a message explaining *why* the change exists, not what changed.

Write the QA report to `qa_report_ISSUE_NUMBER.md` in the repo root (Write tool, absolute
Windows path — never `/tmp/`), post it, delete it:

```bash
gh issue comment ISSUE_NUMBER --repo REPO_SLUG --body-file "qa_report_ISSUE_NUMBER.md"
rm -f qa_report_ISSUE_NUMBER.md
```

Structure (the `<!-- QA-REPORT -->` marker is required — `/complete-work-item` looks for it):

```markdown
<!-- QA-REPORT -->
## 🚀 Implementation Report — #[number]: [title]

### What Was Built
[2–3 sentences: the feature, where the user finds it, the main moving parts.]

### Files Created / Modified
| File | Action | Description |

### Build Status
✅ Release build passed. / ❌ [errors]

### Unit Test Results
| # | Test | Status | Notes |

**Total: X passed, Y failed, Z skipped.**

### App Verification
| # | Check | Expected | Actual | Result |

### ⚠️ Manual Testing Required
[Numbered scenarios with steps and expected results, for anything automation could not
reach — interaction paths, and anything needing MTG Arena running.]

### AC Completion Status
- [x] **AC1**: ...

### Deviations from Implementation Guide
[What differed and why. "None." if nothing did.]

### Open Questions (Unresolved)
### Follow-up Issues to Create
```

Be honest in the report. An unverified path listed under Manual Testing is useful; the same
path implied to be tested is a trap for whoever reads it next.
